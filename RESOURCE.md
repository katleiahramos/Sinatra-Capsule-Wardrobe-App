- base category (workout, lounge, layering, outerware, formal/accessories)
    I built my Base Wardrobe around the concept of 50 total pieces that would not change throughout the year – 10 in each of 5 different categories.

    Workout (pants and tops)
    Lounge (pajamas, yoga pants, big comfy sweatshirts)
    Layering (tanks and tees)
    Outerwear (jackets, swimwear, hats and mittens)
    Formal / Accessories (necklaces, scarves, earrings)


- capsule category  (shoes, bags, jeans, trousers, blazers, dresses, skirts, t-shirts, blouses, button-down, coats, sweaters)
    First, identify three primary outfit categories that are most relevant to your lifestyle. Really imagine a general look/feel for what you would be wearing in each of those scenarios. Here are all of the daily outfit categories I identified:

    Active: gym, kids, on the go, etc.
    Work: office, meetings, etc.
    Dressy: formal events, concerts, etc.
    Fun: restaurants, date night, etc.
    Lounge: movies at home, baking, etc.
    Daily: groceries, errands, work-from-home, etc.


    Now that you’ve identified your primary outfit categories, select 9 tops, 5 pants, and 5 shoes. Choose these items based on three things:

    Their usefulness in each of your outfit categories;
    How well the items fit today;
    How easily you could create an outfit with them based on the other pieces in your capsule.
